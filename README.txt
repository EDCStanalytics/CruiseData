This is an experimental web page to answer the following questions:

1. Can we cheaply replicate the data visualization function that Power BI has been serving on internal servers for use in a public facing report?
2. Can we cheaply and securely (?) store the required data to make the report function?
3. Can we create a data ingestion pipeline that doesn't rely on authentication protocals built into the website?
